### Overview Changes in caflood version 100 **(2014 February)** ###

 1. Major features:

  - Application that performs a 2D flood modelling using cellular
    automata model(s) and it is implemented using the CAAPI.
  
  - There is at the moment one single model implemented WCA2Dv1. This
    model can be used using the command line argument "WCA2D". The
    reference for this model is the unpublished paper:
    Name    : CADDIES: A STREAMLINED, WEIGHTED CELLULAR AUTOMATA 2D 
              INUNDATION MODEL FOR RAPID FLOOD ANALYSIS 
    Authors : M. Guidolin, A. S. Chen, B. Ghimire, E. Keedwell,  
    	      S. Djordjević, D.A. Savić 

  - It needs the version 100 of the CAAPI.

  - The executable takes three arguments:
    1) The input directory with all the data.
    2) A setup file that drive the simulation.
    3) The output directory where the data created is saved

  - The data generated by the simulation can be controlled by output
    setup files which are indicated in the main setup file. There are
    two main types of output, a raster grid and a time/value plot for
    selected point. The physical variable that can be output are water
    depth (WD), water level (WL) and angular velocity (VEL). The
    output raster grid can be produced at specific period of the
    simulation time. Furthermore the PEAK value can be generated.

  - The time step is adaptive and it is controlled by an alpha factor
    which must be set using empirical method.

  - The adaptive time step is updated every larger update step.

  - It is possible to select a global roughness.

  - The model can perform three types of events: rainfall, water level
    change, inflow. All these three events can be performed in a
    specific area or in all the ground.

 2. Minor items:

  - This version is derived from the internal revision 801

  - The output to console can be activated or deactivated in the setup
    file. It is possible to select how often in the simulation time
    the output is produced.

  - It is possible to check the volumes generated by the various
    event and the volume in the domain.

  - It is possible to control how pre/post processing is performed.

  - It is possible to allow the code to start from a small
    computational domain (for example around a inflow source) and
    expand it as needed.

  - It is possible to ignore the upstream cell that do not show any
    further water movement.

  - It is possible to update the peak value of a output raster grid at
    each time step (slow) or at each update step (fast). The
    difference in results is theoretically insignificant.

 3. Known missing features & problems:

  - The total volume generated by a water level event is not computed.

  - The 'Time Start' parameter can be any value, however the simulation
    will not load any previous generated output.

  - The 'Update DT' parameter cannot have any value over 60
    seconds. The value must be a multiple of 60, i.e 30,15.
